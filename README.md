# Wireshark Profiles Repository
Welcome to all my Fellow Packet Analysts/Sniffers, Network Troubleshooters, and Wireshark geeks!

We have been asked countless times over the years to share, and provide a sharing place for, Wireshark Profiles.  

As most of you who are Wireshark users know, this is perhaps the most important capability of Wireshark that speeds troubleshooting and elimination of false positives.  Check out this video on the power of Wireshark Profiles:

You can also get these profiles from our repository on our web site: https://www.cellstream.com/wireshark-profiles-repository/
And/or you can join our Wireshark Profiles channel on Discord: https://discord.gg/3D6xks7eqD

Yet there are almost no repositories for Wireshark profiles.  

What???? :frowning:

In fact, I just attended a Wireshark related Webinar where one of the presenters said (and I quote exactly) they "do not like sharing profiles", because, they said "you don't know what things have been set in the profiles that you yourself have not created"!

What???? :astonished:

I mean, I get the point, someone could sneak something into the profile that is bad.  So you should be wary of this.  
You should unzip a zipped profile and make sure it only contains TXT files.  
That said, this is no reason to not share profiles.  It's like saying you should not use open source software because you never know who inserted something into the code.  
Possible, but in the long run, as long as you are wary, this thinking is ridiculous.  

We try to state below what changes we have made, additions to, etc. the profiles we offer.  WE DO NOT POST ANYTHING WE WOULD CONSIDER SHADY.

## How To Use Our Repository Profiles
It is now super easy to add our profiles to your Wireshark system.

1. Simply download the profile you want (they are all zipped).
2. Then from your Wireshark GUI, right click on the lower right corner of the Wireshark GUI - in the Profile box.
3. Then simply select: Import> from zip file, and pick the file from your downloads directory.  Now you can select the newly imported profile!!

We have always shared our profiles, but we have never opened up a place for others to share back!  So after much consideration, we have decided to give this a try!  

## Contribute to Our Profile Repository
We have always had the position that it would be unsafe to simply open this up to anyone who wishes to upload anything.  So if you wish to contribute a profile, or you modify/improve one of these profiles, please zip up the profile and email me (andyw@cellstream.com)!  I will post sent profiles here.

Did I just save you time and $$$?  I certainly hope so.
